# CarbonFootprintCalculator
My first hackathon project at an all-girls hackathon in high school!

### Inspiration
The hackathon's theme was to jusst simply produce anything that could raise awareness or solve some sort of problem in the community. My team decided that we wanted to raise awareness for global warming so we came up with a carbon footprint calculator to show users just how much carbon emissions they release when they travel by some kind of gas-powered vehicle since most of use one almost everyday.

### Design
We designed a website that is suppose to show a google API where the user can place two pins (their starting point and ending point) and then the distance between the two pins is calculated into a formula in the backend that outputs their carbon emissions. Since I was only about 16 and this was my first time programming, I decided that I wanted to start off with an easier language like HTML/CSS and I had an interest in front-end development. We programmed the website on 

### Accomplishments
Before this project and hackathon, the most work I ever did in terms of coding was playing around with the HTML/CSS of a Tumblr page. I feel proud that I was able to go out of my comfort zone and attend a hackathon and work on a skill that I didn't really know much about as a junior in high school. At this all-girls hackathon, I used my first online ide, repl.it, to build my first website, as well as working with an API for the first time. I also got to learn how to work with a team and practice project planning for the first time.

### Challenges
A challenge I ran into during this was trying to get the Google maps API to work. Since I had extremely basic and limited computer/programming knowledge, it was difficult for me to implement the API and get it functioning how I intended it to. Currently, the website does not take in the data from the API but instead just displays the map.

### What I would change now
When I was trying to implement the API, I thought there was only one way to implement it and I assumed that you can just somehow attach the API code to the logic in our website to calculate the carbon footprint. During the hackathon, because we couldn't figure out how to attach the API data, we instead just calculated the footprint by taking a double input from the user to use in our calculation in the backend logic. Thinking back on it, I feel like there was a way to pull the a mileage number from the API which we could have used to calculate the distance and technically implemented the API to be working. At the time, I had a limited idea of how variables and properties worked so I couldn't figure out how to get that number from the API.
